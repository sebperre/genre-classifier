""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
You might also like
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed",rap

Whores in this house
There's some whores in this house

I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo (Ah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)
You might also like
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be (Huh)
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind

And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore

Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves (Ayy, ayy)
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front (Vroom, vroom)
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill

And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role

I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate

Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans, though

If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like…

And I get high with my baby (My baby)

And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)

I'm like, ""Hey, what's up? Hello""
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go
I be smokin' dope and you know Backwoods what I roll
Remy Boyz, Fetty eatin' shit up, that's fasho
I'll run in ya house, then I'll fuck your ho
'Cause Remy Boyz or nothin'
Re-Re-Remy Boyz or nothin', yeah

Yeah, you hear my boy
Soundin' like a zillion bucks on the track
I got whatever on my boy, whatever
Put your money where your mouth is
Money on the wood make the game go good
Money out of sight cause fights
Put up or shut up, huh?

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects

Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

You sound like a bitch, bitch
Shut the fuck up
When your fans become your haters
You done?
Fuckin' beard's weird
Alright
You yellin' at the mic, fuckin' weird beard (You want smoke)
We doin' this once
You yellin' at the mic, your beard's weird
Why you yell at the mic? (Illa)

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)
Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still (Hold up)
Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material
…Dictionary…
""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher

And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter

Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer when nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded

Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on

I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is

How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em

I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill

You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case

Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes

I don't compromise, I just penetrate

These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate

Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one

Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me

How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What’s your name, man?”

My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

And Alex got better but his mother went quick

Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
“Alex, you gotta fend for yourself.”
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

There would have been nothin’ left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin’ sugar cane and rum and all the things he can’t afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man (Just you wait)
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!

We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin’ up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him
We fought with him
Me? I died for him
Me? I trusted him
Me? I loved him
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

There's a million things I haven’t done
But just you wait!

Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

God bless you if it's good to ya
America, please take my hand
Can you help me underst—
New Kung Fu Kenny!

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!,"" X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—

This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does

Of drum and bass

I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me

Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable

Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Y'all don't know what's about to happen, baby
(It's everyday bro, everyday)
Team 10
Los Angeles, Cali boy
But I'm from Ohio though, white boy

It's everyday, bro, with the Disney Channel flow
Five mil' on YouTube in six months, never done before
Passed all the competition, man, PewDiePie is next
Man, I'm poppin' all these checks, got the brand new Rolex
And it match the Lambo too, and I'm coming with the crew
This is Team 10, bitch, who the hell are flippin' you?
And you know I kick them out if they ain't with the crew
Yeah, I'm talking about you, you beggin' for attention
Talking shit on Twitter, too, but you still hit my phone last night
It was 4:52, and I got the text to prove
And all the recordings too, don't make me tell them the truth
And I just dropped some new merch, and it's selling like a god church
Ohio's where I'm from, we chew 'em like it's gum
We shooting with a gun, the tattoo just for fun
I Usain Bolt and run, catch me at game one
I cannot be outdone, Jake Paul is number one

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

You know it's Nick Crompton, and my collar stay poppin'
Yes, I can rap, and no, I'm not from Compton
England is my city
And if it weren't for Team 10, then the US would be shitty
I'll pass it to Chance, 'cause you know he stay litty

Two months ago, you didn't know my name
And now you want my fame?
Bitch I'm blowin' up, I'm only going up
Now I'm going off, I'm never fallin' off
Like Mag, who? Digi who? Who are you?
All these beefs, I just ran through, hit a milli' in a month
Where were you? Hatin' on me back in West Fake
Think you need to get your shit straight
Jakey brought me to the top, now we really poppin' off
Number one and number four, that's why these fans all at our door
It's lonely at the top, so we all going
We left Ohio, now the trio's all rollin'
It's Team 10, bitch
We back again, always first, never last
We the future, we'll see you in the past
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!

Hold on, hold on, hold on (Espera)
Can we switch the language? (Ha, ya tú sabe')
We 'bout to hit it (Dale)

Sí, lo único que quiero es dinero
Trabajando en YouTube todo el día entero (Dale)
Viviendo en U.S.A, el sueño de cualquiera (Ha)
Enviando dólares a mi familia entera (Pasta)
Tenemos una persona por encima
Se llama Donald Trump y está en la cima
Desde aquí te cantamos, can I get my VISA?
Martinez Twins, representando España
Desde la pobreza a la fama

It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
It's everyday bro
I said it's everyday bro!
Yo, it's Tessa Brooks
The competition shook
These guys up on me
I got 'em with the hook
Lemme educate ya
And I ain't talking book
Panera is your home
So stop calling my phone
I'm flyin' like a drone
They buying like a loan
Yeah, I smell good
Is that your boy's cologne?

Is that your boy's cologne?
Started ballin', Quicken Loans
Now I'm in my flippin' zone
Yes, they all copy me, but
That's some shitty clones
Stay in all designer clothes
And they ask me what I make
I said, ""It's ten with six zeros""
Always plug merch link in bio
And I will see you tomorrow 'cause
It's everyday bro

Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

Oh, you need better seatin'

The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last

There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal

I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella dope
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand? Man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Now, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it 'cause you never know when it all
Could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjurin'
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket

Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week

I'm not gonna fold or demise

Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right

And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)

I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice

Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain

And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm

But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith
So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...

But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last

Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it

That's why your friends always hatin' on me

Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me

How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?

An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!

Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me (Hey, hey, hey)
Learn from that failure, gain humility (Hey, hey, hey)
And then we keep marching, I said
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A., some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Hahaha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac

Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up! (Yeah)

Check this out (Take money)
You motherfuckers know what time it is

Bad Ay ay ayo hold the fuck up

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Mu', pass the MAC and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, mothafucka, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (Haha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Mothafucka, I hit 'em up!
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Little Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
'Bout to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, hahahaha
They don't wanna see us (Take money)
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us (Take money)
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job? (Take money)
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it (Take money)
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, huh, you wanna fuck with us? (Take money)
You little young-ass mothafuckas (Take money)
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'? (Take money)
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack (Take money)
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now, when I came out, I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth with a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: Fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL, fuck you too!

I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free, Randy

Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real

Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, ""Baby girl, fall in line""
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)

But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it

I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever

Not complicated, it's simple

And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you

(""Fuck all you hoes!"" Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good

But not that many (It's all good)
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty (Check it)

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
You know very well (C'mon)
Who you are (Bankrolls)
Don't let 'em hold you down (Clothes)

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey, yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
I'ma get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains, but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal, my power of speech unimpeachable
Only nineteen, but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, ev'ry disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the—

A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are—meant to be

A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century

(He says in parentheses)

Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

Hey, yo, I'm just like my country

And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot

I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you s-oh, 'anarchy!'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my—

Shot
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants
I'm gonna take a—

Shot
But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I, do or die, wait 'til I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another—

Shot
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught
If you talk, you're gonna get shot

Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is
Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get overexcited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

I imagine death so much, it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?

If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from, some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n' fightin'
I've been readin' 'n' writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'
I'm passionately smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow

Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver?
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
‘Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too

So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it

Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you
Damn…656Embed",rap

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves, a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter, I'm interesting
The best thing since wrestling, infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents; my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake

Big titties, big butt too
Fu-Fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-Ring finger where the rock is
The-These hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz

I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in

You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)

Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs

Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it

"384 ContributorsPound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2 Lyrics
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess

Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg370Embed",rap
"285 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisSame Love Lyrics
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
You might also like
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—

Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!

""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me

I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

-I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
-Kick it with your bitch who come from Parisian
-She know where I get mine from, and the season
-Now she wanna lick my plum in the evenin'

Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til 3005, hol' up

Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend, so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future

I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care

Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin

Man, that's really all I use her for, then kick her out the door

In New York, my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case, a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli' in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talkin' 'bout that cash, but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her, that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her, then I dash home, to the cash, ho

Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his gut, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be forty-six years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie, we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

I wish you would lose yourself on the records

Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (Thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah, there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week

Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?

Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes

She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh

But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what

I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope—

He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
Fuck! I’m tired of this shit!
I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""

I remember that night, I remember that—

I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame

This is not a game…
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied

My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?

Unimportant. There’s a million things I haven’t done but
Just you wait, just you wait…

So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance. He’s a
Bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is…

Helpless…

And I know she is…

Helpless…

And her eyes are just…

Helpless…

And I realize

Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…
Where are you taking me?

I’m about to change your life

Then by all means, lead the way

Number one!

I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less

Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

Schuyler?

My sister

Number two!

He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

I’ll leave you to it

Number three!

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”

She’d be lying

But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn’t sized him
Up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced

Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one

Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'

Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed1.4KEmbed",rap

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you woulda thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves

They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves

I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out

Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See, they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See, that's that privately owned prison
Get your peace today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah

It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like

My '65 speeding up the PCH, a hell of a ride
They don't wanna see us make it, they just wanna divide

Wouldn't see the point of living on if one of us died, yeah
Got that kind of style everybody try to rip off
YSL dress under when she takes the mink off
Silk on her body, pull it down and watch it slip off
Ever catch me cheating, she would try to cut my (Ha-ha-ha)
Crazy, but I love her, I could never run from her
Hit it, no rubber never would let no one touch her
Swear we drive each other mad, she be so stubborn
But, what the fuck is love with no pain, no suffer?
Intense, this shit, it gets dense
She knows when I'm out of it like she could just sense
If I had a million dollars or was down to ten cents

My bitch was the most solid, nothing to solidify
She would never cheat, you'd never see her with a different guy
Ever tell you different, then it's a lie

Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave

Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court

Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage

New Kung Fu Kenny
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck

I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, ""Be cautious!""
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know

If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element

I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way

Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy

I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
(Work) Stand up!

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!

Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie Poppa (baby)
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein gettin' plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shinin' in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin', lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be comin' at Ferg (damn!)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth

Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

Shout out that motherland
12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI
Yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal

Super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip
She say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt
Show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit
The pastor said, ""That nigga turnt""
Pop my collar on my shirt
Make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk
Takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Outta line, pistols barkin' (argh argh), ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it
Be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress

Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's

I hear you talkin' shit, bro you think you're the heat
Please bow down to defeat you're barely mince meat
Stop with the street talk, and start to do the street, walk
Lock yourself in and tell me this, how you gonna battle with this sick shit that I spit bitch
See you still flappin' your jaws, prepare to be thrown in the ocean
In the middle with jaws
Or prefer to be served and severed with claws, knock on the doors Of absolute death you may
But please be ready for the automatic failures you may make
So take this and wait for another dismembering, remembering
The tethering of your dream and how it was minced to pieces
Believe in yourself please, to save you now you'll be needin'
Help from Jesus
You think I'm copy, pastin' please, tell me how you're actin' up
Better be quite or I'ma bout to bitch smack your mouth shut
For good, yeah man talk the hood talk better go back and walk the hood walk you ain't had the taste of a real G
Get back down to your level and prepare to be beat
Writin' on your sheet, like you're deep please bitch your weak
You ain't on my level or a level at all, take a vacation
Up the damn wall and fall
Humpty Dumpty, I must be rusty but you better knock the shit Down if you goin' against me
I'm hard to beat, you're hardly cheese compared to these beats And this emcee
You ready, alright, so come on down, I bet you to do it
Let's see if you got the balls or if you're just truant
To me, yeah let's keep an eye, on your ass as the heat intensifies
Talk to me in a smart tone, prepare to meet your demise
Throw you, a hundred million miles is what I'm finna do
Call me Son Goku
I already told you, what I'm gonna do, finna plow through
Yeah man try to tackle a topic more intense then mine
I always rap from the heart, make the fake rappers sigh
But I really really don't give at all a flying fuck
My chance of making this shit is the same as seein' a flyin' truck
Or it could all depend on some serious luck
Maybe I'll release a track that is heard my millions
Make it big and to the top and make billions
But that's a dream for another day, I'm here to take you down
Don't care what you say
Freestylin' this rap shit to the grave
Rap battlin' bitches in my spare time for loose change
Please, all of you fake ass rappers are plan
Make like like a plane and take the next trip away
Far away, from here I don't need to here your shit anymore
I'm tired of it now, next place to be, will be a fuckin' morgue
But let me just let you all know this, I'm sick of it, all of it
So listen next time I write another track
Listen to the facts I spit, and find it through my old wack rap crap

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it

Then gradually become worse—don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life

Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude
Shouts out to L-Boy, awwwwk
I told you

The big-eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says, ""Catch up, nigga,"" it looks like an accident
Um, flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimicking a panda
It's the dark-skinned nigga, kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga, I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic-contradicting dickhead (Not a Logic)
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semen-scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five-panel, I'll repeat it for the season (Hahaha)
Previous items in the present
With the normal-ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang see, he did come back, though)

To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop, when they shoot, you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool-Aid, Juice

What's up, bitch?
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga, we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak (Yeah)
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga, I'm tryna smoke, bitch, get higher (What up, what up, what's up, smoke)
Domo, where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
'Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah, my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
(We out here)
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look 'cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say, ""Get 'em, Mike G,"" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga, I'm a problem
From Briggs, I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch, I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Culk
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin' area (Motherfuckin' area)
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
('Fore I bury ya)
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
(Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya)
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho, nigga, wassup? (Wassup?)
Wolf Gang so you know we not givin' no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut
So I can cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right, right

Rent a supercar for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga, what can I say?
I'm high and I'm bi, wait, I mean I'm straight
I'ma get you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's just as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, fat burger and fries
Then I made a mil' and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own?
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Goddammit!
Rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Hey, it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pothead, half-baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell (Woo)
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch (Wow)
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit (Woo)
Catch me in the back with Miley's on my lap (Shit)
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat (Cat)

Hah, nigga came through with a 9-bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
Yeah, fuck that
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin, settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) Fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit 'til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixty-day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face (Ugh)
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me, you can't, like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that motherfuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict, I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape... and my shoes
Um, I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later, for our label, yeah, we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends that say the n-word
And the ones who got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
'Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em

But you just a wannabe gunner (Gang!)
Like you was gonna do somethin'
Actin' like you catchin' bodies (Ayy!)
And you got juice, lil' youngin', you buggin'
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery
Bitch, you ain't plugged into nothin'

And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better put a
Strap on, other words if you're gonna
Roll up with your (Gang!) you're gon' need a arsenal
'Cause this bar is over your head
So you better⁠—*gun cock*⁠—have arms if you're gonna pull up (Skrrt!)
Oh, you run the streets, huh?
Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin' himself
He wants to keep up his tough demeanour
So he does a feature, decides to team up with N9na (Yeah)
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
If you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock Demigod
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off of ya
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked on the world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I O. J. the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
A double-edge sword, it cuts both ways, I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle to sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical!)—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster (Yeah!)

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M

Bakit ba laging hinahayaan
Andiyan ka na naman

May lakad ka ba mamaya?
Puwede ka ba makasama sa pag-gagala
Kung sakaling 'di ka puwede
Sabagay, meron din akong ginagawa
Siguro nga napapaisip ka
Ba't ako nangangamusta
Ilang araw ka nang naroon sa panaginip ko
Nag-aalala lang ako baka sa'n ka mapunta
Pero mukhang ayos ka naman
Kahit 'di na kita abalahin pa
Ilang ama namin pa ba ang dapat
Para patago kang mag-alala sakin (uh)
Habang pinapantasya lamang nila
Ay mascara mo sa gabi At
Pitaka mo sa umaga
Yung ""ikaw"" sa likod ng kolorete
Pa din ang nangangahulugan
Sa salitang ""paraiso"" para sakin
Bakit kaya kayamanan ko pading kinikilala
Ang iyong pagtawa
Kahit na sa puso mo man ay
Ilang dosena na din ang kasya
Dati pa 'kong pinagdamutan ng kapalaran
Kaya 'di na bago sakin mawalan ng pag-asa
Ala-una ng umaga na naman

Ride with the mob, Alhamdulillah
Check in with me and do your job
Ferg is the name, Ben Baller did the chain
Tourneau for the watch, presi Plain Jane

Yamborghini chain, rest in peace to my superior
Hermès link could feed a village in Liberia
TMZ taking pictures, causin' mad hysteria
Momma see me on BET and started tearin' up
I'ma start killin' niggas, how you get that trife?
I attended Harlem picnics where you risked your life
Uncle used to skim work, sellin' nicks at night
I was only 8 years old, watching Nick at Nite
Uncle Psycho was in that bathroom buggin'!
Knife to his guts, hope Daddy don't cut him
Suicidal thoughts brought to me with no advisory
He was pitchin' dummy, sellin' fiends mad ivory
Grandma had the arthritis in her hands, bad!
She was poppin' pills like rappers in society
I'll fuck yo' bitch for the irony
I'll send Meechy at yo' ho if yo' bitch keep eyein' me!

Oh, nah, yeah, call me, ball me
Yeah, I'll... bet
Yeah, I'm at the studio, hold up though

I ain't get to roll no weed, I ain't get to roll no Swishers
I was locked up on Christmas, ain't get to see my niggas
Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance
'Cause the same bitch say she down to ride be the main one who tricking
Got Molly mixed with promethazine 'cause every time

I wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind
AK-47's, MAC-11, Glocks, and nines
And all these pussy niggas hating, tryna knock me off my grind

I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel out like a hug, I know
I knew a couple of your friends way before
How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back
All the Cadillac like I'm Teddy Pendergrass
Whippin' on this shit, I'm getting ready, where you at?

Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!

Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)

I'm like, ""Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?""
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)403Embed",rap

(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" (Yah)
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah!)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!"" (Huh?)—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)

Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)

"212 ContributorsCrooked Smile Lyrics
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
You might also like
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down

Hey, lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga, touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck, cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn, I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on (what I'm on)
Nigga, get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother, Skip, boy, I had a good day
Metro PCS, trappin', boy, I'm makin' plays
Fifty Shades of Grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap, I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete, I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes

But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic

With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit

That's a double edge, ""issa knife"" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)

Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth

You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt

"98 Contributors12/04/15: Oxxxymiron vs. Johnyboy Lyrics
Говно, залупа, пенис, хер, давалка, хуй, блядина
Головка, шлюха, жопа, член, еблан, петух… Мудила
Рукоблуд, ссанина, очко, блядун, вагина
Сука, ебланище, влагалище, пердун, дрочила
Пидор, пизда, туз, малафья
Гомик, мудила, пилотка, манда
Анус, вагина, путана, педрила
Шалава, хуило, мошонка, елда…
Раунд!
Вот как я должен был баттлить Дуню
И тех, кто калякал его стишки
Но там перебивали его дружки
Пожелайте им рака прямой кишки
Я был не на коне, я об этом помню
Порой с оппонентом идёшь впритык
Но сегодня я здесь, и сегодня я в форме
Сегодня мой хуй отсосёшь мне ты
Клянусь, я готовился две недели, ты — явно год
Но для беспокойства повода не вижу
Даже если ты прыгнешь выше головы, как ебаный кот
В рассказе Эдгара По, ты все равно на голову ниже
И почему все ждали баттл, как Битву Титанов или херачащих файерболами?
Страшные заклинания, летящие во все стороны?
Панчи, что мне объявят единогласный импичмент?
Какого хуя? Для меня баттлы с Криплом и Дуней были гораздо эпичней
Там хоть бой ветеранов и, как-никак, уважение
Здесь его ведь ни грамма, ты сраное отражение
Я здесь, чтоб вы поржали на пару с пренебрежением
Он ко мне — с обожанием, подражанием, но отторжением
Кто ты, что назойливо мне тут глаза мозолит?
Мой вскормленный Григорием Зориным попсовый сперматозоид?
Клянчил… Клянчил фит, после вызвал на баттл, вот уж «Метаморфозы» Овидия
Но единственным местом
Где наши имена будут стоять относительно тесно
Станет название этого снафф-видео
Я тобой пообедаю, тебе быть удобрением
Ты здесь не за победою, а за моим одобрением
Ведь я бросил тебя, под стать твоему отцу
Но не жди покаяния, как бы ты… Как бы ты ни спешил и буянил
Это оставило внутри тебя экзистенциальную пустоту
Которую ты пытаешься заполнить большими хуями
Он на… Он наказан природой — обидно, тяжко
На рингтоне в Айфоне что? — «Неваляшка»
Чтоб… Чтоб забыть, себя фотает с бритой ляжкой
В зале между подходами — фитоняшка
Он реально до баттла в боксерских перчатках в спортзале заснял фотосет
Я, ебать, обосрался, ты взял с собой капу? Ты взял с собой капу?
Я-то думал, что баттл — эссе
Где ты деконструируешь образ врага, всё, чтоб перехитрить, наебать его
Мне не надо качаться и фоткать себя, чтобы попросту быть обаятельным
Мне не надо везде компромат, рыть на тебя, ведь я не копрофаг
В уши ебать себя, слушать тебя
Для того, чтобы выдать тебе саркофаг
Нет, я тебя вижу насквозь — рентген
Обидочка, злость
У него дома плакаты со мной
И на фейсе — мишень, чтобы тише спалось
Окей, кто здесь хочет сыграть в игру?
«П» — предсказуемость
Я берусь угадать его панчи, но, знайте, никто не сливал инфу
Что он может нарыть про меня? Сто пудов, анекдот на баяне
Ведь он мыслит двумерно
С еблом петуха, хоть и в рэпе не Hotline Miami, ну, может быть, кто-нибудь поймёт
Всякий раз, когда он зачитает, что предсказывал устно Мирон
Вы услышите: «Мо-мо-мо-мо»
Называется «грустный тромбон», окей?
Готовы? Запоминайте темы, вот первая:
Он скажет то, что гей не он, а я
Что некий рэпер мне за оскорбления навалял
Потом, что его предал я, что вечный лицемер
И что судейство Версуса на чьей-то стороне
И будут упомянуты в который раз лещи
И назовёт Оксаною, которая пищит
И знаешь… И зная, что засрут, будет смеяться над собой
И скажет, что я трусил целый год соваться в бой
Скандал, разоблачение, интриги, слухи, грязь
Все вывалит, задеть меня, так лихо ухитряясь
И словно приговор в ответ на все его слова
За серость и за скуку будет: «Мо-мо-мо-мо»
Убедишь ли ты сплетнями эту толпу?
Навредишь ли моей репутации, мальчик?
Нет, у меня тоже есть скелеты в шкафу
Но это скелеты тех, с кем я баттлился раньше
У меня в плане сплетен о нём — ничего
Я газеты про звезд не листаю
Не смогу процитировать строчки его
Потому что их просто не знаю
И потому что их другие, большинство
Тоже просто не знают, так что процитирую свои:
Знаешь, у тебя смешное ебло
И сегодня оно мне обещает страдание, но
Я лишь подавляю зевок
Ведь я знаю все то, что ты скажешь заранее
Я всё это слышал тысячи раз, тысячи фраз, что меня пытались подкалывать, но
Я лишь угораю с тебя тут, жалкое ты, право, создание…
Раунд!

То, что у тебя на шее — это не просто очень
Ты вчера тусил, и это засос от Porchy?
Скажу сразу, бровастый, пусть я гелем вымазан
Но я въебал Оксане, а Ресторатор это вырезал, раунд!
Шутка, а то напряглись твои кенты
Кстати, их тут много, и подсуетился, видно, ты
Владелец Версуса с недавних пор — Илья Мамай
А снимал Версус Охра, он же Джони Рудбой
И пусть кричат тут два кента моих: «Давай, давай!»
Выиграть в толпе друзей Мирона будет очень трудно
Но, Мирон, ты готов проиграть? Это лажа, беда
У меня нет бороды, но ты скажешь мне «да»
И вообще, я удивлён, я ждал подвох, точнее, давай прямо
Я думал, вместо тебя выйдет твой клон или, кх-кх-кх, твоя мама
Про твою маму ничего плохого не могу сказать я, честно
Твоя мама — королева, ведь только королева могла воспитать принцессу
Но раз ты здесь, начнём. Батлить со мной — неприлично опасно
Ты мой личный Galat, я твой личный D. Masta
Да-да, батлить со мной — неприлично опасно
Я твой личный Noize MC, ты мой личный Хованский
Итак, шарада, но угадаешь лишь ты, пуф-пуф
Да, Мирон, это ты получаешь пизды
Вы думаете, я банален и говорил про Джигана?
Я про ту инфу, что как язва, тебя внутри прожигала
Скрыть твоя персона этот конфликт пожелала
Но войдут в тебя следующие мои рифмы кинжалом
Умолял его в сеть видео не лить — не слил
Выебнулся в трубку, но живьём рамсить нет сил
Ты слёзно у него себя простить просил
Но, Мирон, признайся всем — тебя отпиздил ST1M!
Почему ты об этом не расскажешь людям?
Ты же говоришь, что с… Ты самый честный эмси
Но сказанное тобой — липа
Единственный честный эмси — это бухой Крипл
Тя реально отпиздил ST1M. Никита, мы ждём видео
Я вылил на тебя эту инфу, как лаву
Думал, СД прикроет спину, сучка? Хуй там плавал
Позже на Твиттере писал ты: «Билли Миллиган — герой»
То ты не думал, что инфу мне эту слили бандеролью
Окси, ты женственней Бритни Спирс в клипе «Toxic»
А я безбашенный ублюдок, меня зови Джонни Ноксвилл
И не жалейте щас его, ведь жертва тут я
Ведь он придумал все рифмы на «О-кси-ми-рон» уже до меня
Но, Мирон, я поражаюсь: Шокк, Fogg
В гримёрках, где я тоже был, пишут, что Окс — лох
На моём месте должен был быть немецкий тот, кто
Тебя отпиздил бы, ты почти умер, но начался дождь в slow motion
Он падает на колени и делает тебе дыхание рот в рот
No homo, как говорит Drago
Но Шокк разок хотя бы точно тебе засадил в сраку, но щас не об этом
Вы думали, скажу: «Мирон мне был с роддома другом»
И мы внатуре обрезались у одного хирурга
Я был его фанатом, но он выбрал Шокка, сука!
Таких ждал слов, Иуда? Но тогда ты что-то спутал
Я мог сказать, мы были круче Сойера и Финна
Эх, как ужинали мы с тобой мацою у раввина
Мы были как пупок и пуповина
Нет, я бы принимал всё слишком близко к сердцу
Будто укол адреналина, ну, или Jubilee
Ведь всё иначе совсем, с годами мальчик взрослел
Понял, что всё это — хуйня и не иначе как смех
Ты обычный рэпер, я отличный рэпер
И все псевдоконфликты наши, как неудачный концерт
Щас ты завязал, а раньше, помнишь, был неудачник-пьяница
Но мотивирует тебя мечта стать когда-то богаче Яникса
Но забудь про признаки жизни, Джони словом ебёт в анал
Я заказал твою голову, и ты мне её подал
Помню, по-дружески писал тебе: «Моя мама — твой фан»
Но даже она сейчас желает, чтоб ты меня растоптал
Но после бойни, хуй с тобой
Тебя ждёт досадный, разочарованный, страдальческий и рискованный, бесславный, блядь, и тяжёлый, и, наконец-то, долгий путь домой
(Ой, блядь) Про драку два года назад —, ебать, ты Пинкертон, друже
ST1M, в отличие от тебя, не выносит говно наружу
Токо ты не ST1M, панк, тик-так, мой стиль тебя угостит так
Что тебе понадобятся механизмы в организме, как стимпанк, сука! Let's go!
Это всё, на что ты был способен?
Пара слухов, тупой анекдот, и ты все еще баттлишь в основе?
На Фреш-бладе ты б выбыл в отбор, в Краснодаре порвали б на «Слове»
Ты нелеп, словно Гарри Топор, но с лицом Того Самого Коли
Ты в санаторий не спеши, это ещё цветочки
Мы оба знаем, кто вершина пищевой цепочки
Но твоих фанов мне не надо, я даже сделал специальный тюториал
Зная, что меня слышит твоя целевая аудитория
Я хочу обратиться к его целевой аудитории:
«Ты так любишь сказки про пони, не знаешь пока о тампоне
И дома, когда никого нет, болеешь на баттлах за Джонни
И если я вынесу Джонни, останься поклонницей Джонни
И так уже сотни тупых мокрощёлок, как ты, меня в Инсте фолловят, сука
Смотри: бро — не бро
И через много-много лет, когда ты узнаешь про эмансипацию женщин и геолокацию клитора
Приходи на мой концерт отрываться, конечно, а пока слушай мелкого пидора
Он копирует стиль подсознательно и, походу, травма детская
Там ему говорили все воспитатели: «Слышь, ты чё такая гейская, а?»
Все мы знаем, он Маршалла тексты переводит, копируя флоу
Я подумал, что стало бы, если всем бы стало так тырить не влом?
Для него Эминем — потолок, эталон, этот Стэн любит красть просто явно
Для меня весь хип-хоп — каталог. Итого: я бы мог воровать постоянно
И подростки в сети, и Хованский, простите, вы вряд ли поймёте чего-то
Для всех остальных этот аудионоситель — «Краткая переводная история хип-хопа»
Окей, интересно, сколько треков вы узнаете. Готовы?
Не тол-кни, ведь я на кра-ю
И я стре-млюсь не те-рять бо-шку
А-ха-ха, ха-ха
Это был hip-hop, hippie to the hippie, to the hip-hip-hop
Это мой стайл, ребята, это bang-bang-boogie
Давай, делай boogie, это rhythm, это boogie и beat
То, что вы слышите, не тест, я рэп кладу на бит
Без-ра-ботица повсюду
Знаю, люди приходят и уходят, чтобы уми-рать
Я не знаю сам, так что не спраши-вай
Но это так здесь и, значит, нечем крыть
Где перемены? Я просыпаюсь утром и виню себя
Зачем так жить, лучше убью себя
Крэк детям продают, совести нет же
Хоть на голодный рот, но будет меньше
— Окей, подумай, расслабься, дыши медленно
— Ну, уж нет, ты застукал дрянь за изменою!
Пока ты в поте лица пахал, она скачет голая, слышь
Перережь ей горло, отрежь этой суке голову!
— Стоп, может, есть объяснение для этой шалости?
— Что, она поскользнулась, упала ему на фаллос?
Я всю жизнь хо-тел денег и славы
Респект давай или свинец хавай
Хочу, чтоб хер стал, как Эйфелева башня
Чтоб я мог трахать мир семьсят два часа и не кашлять
Пиздец у меня здесь девок! Если бы я всех девок
Вместе собрал, то здесь бы жена, любовница, дева
Слышишь, я всю жизнь хотел денег и славы
Респект давай или свинец хавай
Ну пошумите, если узнали что-то, c'mon!
Знаешь, что это было? Доказательство твоей вербальной нищеты
Знаешь, почему? Я даже копирую чужие стайлы оригинальнее, чем ты
Ведь хотя мой не тянет на тридцатку еблет
Но в хип-хопе я дед и бывалый
Подумай, я ебашу хип-хап уже больше семнадцати лет
Это дольше, чем живут на свете все твои фаны
И ты часто пытался ебашить быстро, получалось нелепо и глупо
Ведь ты белый, что слушает белых — у тебя нету свэга и грува
Ты ведь часто пиздел про Green Park или грайм — лучше дальше, давай, лебези
Я покажу, как грайм читают настоящие эмси, смотри
Oi, you. Ты знаешь всё обо всех?
Ты думал, что я сдулся, думал, что опопсел?
Но кто тебе поведал про грайм и дабстеп?
И четыре года кряду я в туре, ты гомосек
То есть, oi! Ты случайно не оборзел?
Не подходи сюда, между нами водораздел
Если бы моя башка не висела не волоске
Сколько раз, я вряд ли бы делал то, что хотел
И мой рэп не стал бы ничем, если бы не город
«Лондон против всех» из копеечных мониторов
Ноль восемь, Окси чего? Позор, позер!
Но сколько рэперков под это до сих пор косят
Я жил, где мечети, ямайцы и Сенегал
Теперь по моим приключениям снимается сериал
Я эмси, но пойманный в теле авантюриста
Заболтаю всех, даже телеевангелистов
Сколько слов было, сколько зубов выбито
Сколько всего выпито дома у Ноу-Лимита
Город, флоу, мимика, голос, бетон, лирика
На лавке в Грине было фристайлить с Den Bro принято
Эй, тогда я работал, как вол, много
Нынче получаю, как раньше за полгода
Эй, Markul у людей играет в подкорке
Видел Локибоя, он выступает в Гонконге
Green Park жив, пока живы мы
Скажи, кто раньше был? Разве шире наши ряды?
Ненамного, мы не ушли, не зашили рты
В этом деле с начала движа гроши, мы были бедны
Лондонград — из андеграунда на экран
От камер наблюдения до кинокамер на кран
От окраины и локального хайпа баттловика
Из Грин-парка и Кеннинг Тауна с майком и на века, сука!
Знаешь, у тебя хорошая сучка
Сегодня ночью я устрою ей хорошую взбучку
(Вряд ли, братан, вряд ли)
(Сомневаешься?)
Ты поднял бровь, включил агрессивную читку и зачитал, дядь
Так и хочется сказать: «Да замолчи ты, блядь, ты заебал, блядь»
И я послушал твой текст. О чём ты вообще, придурок ссаный?
Я пришёл бэтлиться с Оксимироном, а в итоге ебу Оксану
Цитата, чтоб всё понял твой британский белый зад:
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
(Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go)
И когда-то стану богатым…
И когда-то стану богатым
На подтанцовке будет дэнсить Beyonce и мама Галата
У меня нет ни лейбла, ни букинга — я ещё проще
Да, и хоть пребываю то в говне, то в ещё большем кале
Могу сказать, что я счастливый, и лайв мой шикарен
Ведь твоя подруга смотрит на меня и думает: «Ух, какой же парень»
Следующая рифма стара, как мир, но я специально её, признаться, не менял
Я настолько высоко, что Олимп мечтает забраться на меня
Но пора тебе уже стать выше Джона
Я заебался платить алименты твоим бывшим жёнам
Оксана, ёпта, Оксана, ёпта, ты сам подъёбка
Поразила меня в твоих текстах находка
Madchild, Ghetts, Savas — смешались все стили
Просто ты косишь под тех, кого массы не знают в России
Твои пламенем синим мечты сгорают в камине
Я успех на батле, как альбом ты свой, посвящаю Карине
За мои панчи хочешь дать мне по рылу с ноги?
Мирон, как Markul, сука, но выходит сухим из вагин
«Сухим из вагин, сухим из вагин» — твоя любимая песня
Да, режет Василенко по живому
Один, пять, десять, двадцать, тридцать, сорок, блядь, я в тебе вижу пятьдесят оттенков голубого
Просто я видел твою тёлку или парня-тёлку
Или парня-тёлку или парня
Просто не понятно мне что-то
У твоей бывшей волос меньше, чем у меня на мошонке
Бро, это беда, блин, теперь мы поняли, не так ли?
Чтоб кончить, там нужны плётки, японки и тентакли
Помню, ты звонил и сказал мне: «Я её кладу на лопатки
Одеваю ей пакет на голову и зову её ugly
Джони, так больше не могу», а я такой: «Хочешь, помогу?»
Теперь ты знаешь, на твоих концертах откуда фанатки
И, вообще, совет: нравятся лысые киски —
Купи себе сфинкса, йоу
Я здесь не чтоб с тобой мериться стажем хип-хоповым
Я это делаю ради тех, кто со мной в этом также закопаны
Ведь весь мой жизненный опыт, что нажит, накоплен был
Заставляет меня ебашить, и я ебашу как проклятый
Спасибо всем, кто в меня верит, это действительно клёво
Люди из СНГ всего просили снести долбоёба
И, чтобы ты не обижался, оставляю послание:
Я лишь выполняю программу, я лишь выполняю задание, раунд

Ты что-то вякнул про подругу? Мы расстались давно
Но она мне близкий человек, чё ты базаришь, говно?
Ты хуесосишь своих бывших в треках, сраное дно
Значит, то же самое ждёт твою теперешнюю даму потом, логично?
Окей, смотри, все твои темы я почти здесь верно предсказал
И, честно, всем твой уже действует на нервы детский сад
Но есть ещё одна тема, что в воздухе висит
Я знал, что ты начнёшь копать, ведь ты безмозглый детектив
Но ничего, и без него её тут форсят нефигово
Вот она: «Versus — это заговор, проект Оксимирона»
Все навострили ушки
Раз уж ты начал — получай, про Рудбоя, Мамая…
Так как слухи ползли тут многие
Давайте поговорим об этом в духе конспирологии
Versus — проект Оксимирона, есть только два варианта:
Либо это ёбнутый вздор, либо это тайная правда
Допустим, что это вздор, что же в сухом остатке?
Санёк Ресторатор построил нам баттл, повысил в хип-хопе все ставки
И пусть половина читала стихи тут с блокнота, как Баста с подставки
Всё же для каждого, кто поучаствовал, в шоу не найти недостатки
Я могу говорить за себя, я могу говорить за него
Эта промоплатформа, которой нет равных, даст фору просмотрам The Flow
Вот смотрите: я не жополиз, не нацист, если лысых пиарю
Но считаю, что каждый, кто ждал этот выпуск, Саньку должен быть благодарен
Кто кричит, что всё это — моё, утверждает, что Саня тут — пешка
И всё это масонское ложе, осознанна ложь и тотальная слежка
Нехуёвое, блядь, заявление, у вас, что, Земля в иллюминаторе?
Плюс любой долбоёб, кто такое несёт, выдаёт дисреспект Ресторатору
Так что если брехня, что босс Версуса я, и не правда ничто из того
То кричащий так — неблагодарный, к Саньку не лояльный, гнилой пиздабол
Ну а если второй вариант, и всё верно, что вам доносили?
Я придумал огромный проект, поменявший весь вектор хип-хопа в России
От ST и до Нойза, СД и до Лоика — здесь каждый почти что замечен был
Коль за этим стоял ваш покорный слуга, то вменять мне практически нечего
Ведь выходит, что раз я масон, тамплиер и окутанный тайною лидер
Что я реанимировал сотни карьер, даже тех, кто меня ненавидит
Что ве… Что вернул старичков, протолкнул новичков от нулей до добротных артистов
Что собрал сорок лямов просмотров мечтой и ещё заработал на Клинском
И что… И… И-и что всё это время я пробыл в тени — так, какой-то там пиццы доставщик
Если это всё правда, народ, извини, мне придётся хвалиться — красавчик
И отныне любой, кто кудахчет, что я Versus собрал, изобрёл
Говорит либо «Oxxxy — красавчик», либо то, что он сам пиздобол
С этим разобрались
(Кто вообще это говорил, друг мой?)
Вернёмся к тебе
Тебя часто зовут «гейлорд» — это непр… Это неправильный выбор
Гей — это Оскар Уайлд, Чайковский, ты лишь маленький пидор
Ну и что, я же вырос в Европе, у нас принято быть толерантным
Хоть и грима на нём, словно Культ Злые Клоуны сделали клип с Тони Раутом
Его малый размер гениталий, продолжительность секса куцая
Это всё его личное дело, тут не следствие, тут экзекуция
Кровосток не при чём — у тя шило в жопе, хы, ты звал поскорее к барьеру
Я пришёл, так что пару слов на посошок о закате твоей карьеры
Готов? Ты не готов
Окей, Аврора, Космонавт — звезда кичилась так задиристо
Мол, собираю тысячи в залах питерских на выездах
Проходит всего год, из его пидорства все выросли
И он в клубе Backstage, где по вместимости четыреста
Хватит корчиться, креативить, твой предел мечты — иномарка
Нахуй творчество — ты продуктивен, как конвейер, свиноматка
Каждый год по альбому, а толку? Где шум?
Пусть меня называют спасителем
Но это не баттл, мой друг, а спасательный круг
Который я тебе бросаю, как исполнителю
Токо ты не заметишь, ведь ты одноклеточный, как инфузории-туфельки
Твой мир опереточный выцветет, деточка, как в лепрозории трупики
И ты даже сейчас нихуя не сечёшь, это как говорить, блядь, с клопами
Твой эмоциональный диапазон плюс интеллектуальный горизонт перпендикулярно завален
Но давай объясню, чтоб ты понял, малец, почему твой успех будет тусклым
Раз уж так повелось, что я крёстный отец для всего бэттл-рэпа на русском
Глянь: Хуяксы и Хатты, Шотганы, Грехи, блядь, снусмумрики и хатифнаты
ИнДаБаттла копирки под Sound by Keam, Хаи, Оксикаримы и Святы
Все давно научились читать, все давно научились панчить
Однотипно шутить, слоги в рифме считать, даблтаймить и байтить Тек-Найна
И ты, вроде, был самый успешный из них, но вы все одну вещь позабыли:
Дело не в количестве панчей, не в качестве рифм — дело в личности, что за ними
И поскоку ты, сука, ебаный планктон, безголовее, чем Нэд Старк
Тебе никогда не занять мой трон, Гре… Грейджой Теон, ведь ты даже не мой бастард
Да ты сам… Да ты сам посмотри, бар с названием каким: тут не просто трактир, а семья
Может, ты и вынесешь меня из 1703, но не 1703 из меня
1-7-0-3
1-7-0-3 — это Питер, детка, и мне якорь иной здесь не нужен
Эмигрировал мелким, не жил двадцать лет тут, но я коренной петербуржец
Ну а ты лимита тут, ведь ты имитатор
Я — инноватор, ты — InDaBattle
Johnyboy? Johny, bye! Твой хип-хоп — шапито
Johny, пой, не читай, ты никто и ничто
И неважно кто скажет, что я победил или ты, голосов будет множество
Но любой, кто придёт на концерты твои, как и ты, лишь пустое ничтожество
И напоследок: кто меня вызывает на баттлы, вам плотная тоже летит
Я не про тя, на тя уже похуй, можешь идти
Кто меня… Кто меня вызывает на баттлы, чтоб вы тут себе этим ни прочили
За меня отвечает Шариков: «В очередь, сукины дети, в очередь»
А пока что вы можете тем козырнуть, что я сдал, потому что мне ссыкнотно
Я приду и тебя разъебу, но тогда, когда мне это будет выгодно
Ведь белого или негра, — кого забэттлить, — мне похую
Пидора или гетеро, рэпера или рокера
Профи или ноунейма, ботана или гопа
Для эго любых размеров есть гробик в моём Некрополе
Раунд!

Вы подумали что-то про это, сударь, вы были грубым
Да, у меня стальные яйца, стальной характер и стальные зубы
И я послу… И вообще, твой текст — говно, скажи правду, не бойся
Ты читаешь фристайл из солидарности к Нойзу?
Оу да, я бомж, но и ты не богат, бомжара
Гораздо успешней твой клон, ведь ты вылитый Марат Башаров
И это не шутка, бросьте
У меня две ноги, две руки, два уха, два глаза, один нос, — блядь, я кошу под Окси
Это баттл века, так что, правда, нехуй
Говорить, что я никто, читаю как калека
Моя планка — небо, мне нужна победа
Тех, кто хает, унижает, ожидает пекло
Ты придумал двойные рифмы, сука? Ты сейчас бредишь!
Так Drago с Крип-а-Крипом рифмовали в две тысячи третьем
В тебе четверть еврея, четверть русского и полцыгана
Ты МЦ, только если твоё имя — Мирон Цекало
Ты можешь уличить меня в попсе, но, прошу, скажи
Это мне скажет автор поп-хита «Мне скучно жить»?
Это Версус, и не могу не пошутить на тему хуёв, пацан
Если ЛСП тебе предложит червонец за blowjob, ты соснёшь хуйца
Не спорю, он талант, но он в твоём очке уже глубже водолаза
Ты сучий парень, ты хитришь и любишь садо-мазо
Дуня уже тебя трахнул, но передал свою любовь для Дини
Так вот, Дуня, я в этой шалаве, как Молодой Трезини, с головой в трясине, блядь
Вчера в попсе, сегодня в бэтлах — это злобно, но верно
Да, я меняю свой курс каждый день, будто доллар и евро
Другие назовут это пера пробой, наверное
Просто мне двадцать три, я молод и мне похуй на это
Может, кому-то и понятно, но, ебать, мне — нет
Как можно так стремать ошибок, чтоб в стол писать семь лет?
Как можно настолько не любить музыку, чтоб все, ебать, побить рекорды?
Выпускать куплет за год, а альбом не писать четыре года?
Ты станешь, Окси, артистом
Если завяжешь с этой заумной хуетой в текстах, которую понимают только аутисты
И ты соберёшь свой «Олимпийский»
Точнее, каждую соринку, стакан, бутылку, окурки в нём после легендарного шоу от Дениса
Они… Они, враги, навечно распускают слухи, детки
Может, выпьем водяры, обсудим, что все суки девки?
Может, пожмём напоследок друг другу руки крепко?
Ну и давай наконец-то уже…
Замутим селфи! Ха-ха-ха
Но, повторюсь, если б моим лучшим другом был бы Окси
Мне русский рэп тогда не интересен был бы вовсе
И поэтому нас ждёт вечная вражда, даун
И этот бэттл значит, что тебе пизда, раунд!71Embed",rap

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
Until my legs, until my legs
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
Give out from underneath me
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
Until the roof, until the roof
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps

The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin', girl, and you might feel like nothin' was the same

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions

Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'

Hit 'em with no condoms, shipped her right back out the country

And the peaches and the mangos
That you could sell for me

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, ""What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?""
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, ohh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered

Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you

By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin'

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong

I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie

They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit

Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'

"116 ContributorsThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Lyrics
Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

Well, uh
The plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, Holmes, to Bel-Air!""

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie ""Yo', Holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air76Embed",rap

Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?

You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none

I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look

Soon as they close that door, we just gon' walk down
They say we dead wrong 'cause we knocked him off
But he who got caught lackin', tell that bitch that that's his fault
If we draw down, guns get let off
At all them clowns, including his spouse
Kept that blick inside my drawers
Every time I walked to Dalton
I worked for Tim and sold CD's
You throw a diss and you get tossed
Say you ain't catch that, cross my name up, ain't no talking (Yeah)
If they had a bang-out at the store, from my papa window, I could see it sparkin'
But I ain't seen that since Jordan Dixon made some niggas some targets

I just wanna be loved

Don't nobody understand me though
Tahj Money
The way I came in the game
The image that I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That's why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still bein' me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we goin' out, you hear me? Open your mouth

I say, ""Mama, I'm so sorry""
I got ice burned where my heart at
On the road where I had it hard at
How I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless
I ain't know my age, he was sixteen, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from 'way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me

Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me

I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beepin', plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out

Bitch, I'll take these millions to get at you, it ain't no gettin' at me
Bitch, I'll send them hitters to hit at you, boy, don't say shit to me
Talked to Drake 'cross FaceTime, he wasn't feelin' me

Told me that he like the shit I'm doin', but can't do shit with me
So when we cross our ways, fuck what you say, bitch, you my enemy
J a ho, that nigga played it cold like he was gon' do a feature
So I texted his line a muscle sign, I swear it's gon' be nice to meet you
Pussy niggas tryna close the door
Bitch, you ain't heard? Back from Baton Rouge to that 'Nolia, we cutthroat
And we hate hoes
And bitch, I'm soldiered down
Might play you close, but don't fuck around
I just tried to pull that act off with them boys out that Atlanta town, hold on
Tats all on my sleeve, at night, can't sleep, I barely eat, grew up in streets
Bitch, you ain't never had to kill at just sixteen
You don't compare to me and never up in life, we couldn't compete
You wanna jump in beef and none of y'all wanna bang it out with YB

And I know when the rain pour, it could be me or either of them that's gone

So I'm ready, nigga, with these millions, gettin' at you bitch niggas
You don't deserve it anyway, you ain't out that dirty anyway, so fuck you, nigga
Tryna bring me pain, I ain't do no ho shit in this game

Play with me, Lil Yachty mad about JT, faggot
Bitch, play with me, half of y'all ain't got more money than me, bitch, I've been stackin'
I done did more time than more time you niggas spent inside the trenches
Ever had a nigga beat your mama and now that you're older, time to kill 'em?
Or put your dirty clothes inside the pillowcase? You pussy nigga
Singers puttin' tattoos across they face, fuck wrong with these niggas?
Usin' hood niggas for to grow your face, bitch, I see that, nigga
Nigga, you a trick and that's how you know you'll never be known in the trenches
Tryna think of somethin' else just for to say, I hate you niggas
Nigga, bring your bold ass to Salt Lake, you a gangster, nigga
Go ask J. Prince, I'll kill your daddy, bitch, I ain't worried, nigga

Went to jail, came home
Jason (Haha)
Man, say, I-I feel good, nigga, I don't—
And it's— you know, my first time bein' on the mic, nigga
Went to jail, came home
Who am I? Like, aha, who was I?
You know, I guess words don't even matter
You know we movin' forward
Went to jail, came home, time passed, went back again
All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end
I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends
I was criticizin' myself like, you ain't never gon' win

Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids
I'm like, ""Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it""
I'm like, ""DeSean, thuggin', you just hustlin' backwards
Nigga, you done won
I just fail to accept that you not good for anyone""
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
I can feel it in my soul

They say that he ain't gon' be here long
I see myself on top the mountain
I'm smokin' strong, I'm keepin' strong
No more ridin' with that window down
Hangin' out, tryna lay them down
My soul, I still ain't think I found
When I tell bro on the phone
I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now
So my girl don't want her a bust down
I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now
I been wanna do right since I touched down
I been watchin' the way I influence now
I ain't post not a picture, I moved on
I'm responsible to all these children now
Even though they label me teflon
Back into my normal home
Back inside my closet, puttin' that VLONE on
Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone
First time got her in my arms like, ""I can't leave you alone""
With all these thoughts on top my dome

I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me
They gon' kill me if they can
No need for dissin', come get rid of me

So tell 'em, ""Ain't no time for sympathy""

Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me
It ain't get to me, nah, every time you said that you ain't shit to me
Even though you meant the world to me

Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now
Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now

It's early noon and I'm druggin', tryna fuck me somethin'
Get one to pull up on me and I'm gon' do me somethin'
Since I was sixteen, had money, I say, ""I grew up stuntin'""
They hatin', they laugh, it ain't nothin' 'cause I'm gon' burn me somethin'
Now, you could think I'm stuntin', I put that on my mama
I say, I stay up in somethin', that's why we stay with them choppers
I know them slimes totin' somethin' and they be all with that drama
They pull up, jump, I start bustin' and make a bitch quit that talkin'

I hop out first with that chopper, I bust first at them cowards
I had some beef with some niggas, I straight fucked over they partners
I made shit sеize through the city and I sent blitz with thеm dollars
And I was the first to drop hits, bitch, I went crazy with bodies
And I was fucked up with Ten, wear the same clothes, that's my partner
He broke the code and I zipped him, this nigga used to be on side me
I was mad at my boy, but, shit, I'm grown, you can't stop me
He got me hooked on that boy, we both was goin' through some problems
Young nigga cutthroat, you saw it, he either slime or a goblin
You know I'm with it, YoungBoy, I kill that bitch 'front his mama
Like, thirty days straight, I ain't sleep from two to three
Like, thirty days straight—
Hold on, let me catch again
I say, thirty days straight, I ain't sleep from two to three
I went thirty days straight, I was rollin' off the bean
It been thirty days straight she had an attitude with me
I'ma get that ass straight, I'll stab that pussy 'til it bleed
In a new 38 chain, I got that bitch on her knees
Buy lil' baby anything and she ain't gotta ask me please
I'ma kill a pussy nigga, fuck your boy and what you bleed
I want your face on top the pavement 'bout that fuckin' playin' with me
I had your mama at the precinct every day to tell on me
That rap boy, he ain't safe, haha, bitch, please
They patch him up, couldn't even stitch him from that hole left with that heat
Spoke on us, I gotta see, get his last rollout on a tee
It ain't no bitch that I need, I need Visine
I be grindin' and she on side me
And she can't love me 'cause I'm too slimey
I'm wherever them diggers be, you know right where to find me
Though they got me fucked up, I came up, don't care 'bout nothin'
I'ma get 'em bust up, he fucked up, don't tell me nothin'
I'ma get your head bust, lil' nigga, all that fuckin' stuntin'
They gon' lay his head on the pillow if we creep up on him
Baby, I'm too yeah on these niggas, I got plenty money
Bae, I leave shit dead, industry just don't like me for nothin'
Gettin' at all they ass with this money, tell 'em, ""Do me somethin'""
Bitch, I got that sack, and on your head, I'll put it on you
Ring around the rosie, my diamonds are frozen

If my brother need it, then I got him, man, the whole gang know how I'm bleedin'
Tryna wake up from them nightmares, devil in my ear while I'm dreamin'
In my past life, did some bad things, I know karma tryna get even
Tryna get away from all the drama, hopped in the Benz, now I'm speedin'

Told 'em I was gonna be somethin'
That broke shit made me sick, big appetite with a weak stomach
Ain't had nowhere to go, nigga, I was lost in them streets runnin'
And I hit Rodeo just to get stylish, ran through three hundred
Just happy I did it, nigga, nobody ever gave me nothin'
Flexin' so hard I might pull a muscle, but I just keep stuntin'
Thirty in the mag, you get body-bagged, I'm just gon' keep dumpin'
Police get behind me, I'ma press the gas, I'm just gon' keep stompin'

Goofy tried stealin' my formula
Look, these niggas corny, these niggas can't come on my corner
I'm the one do what I wanna
I made the guys spin that bitch every day like a carnival
Bought her a Patek Philippe 'cause she wanted one
These niggas nothin' like me, I am one of one
Take the Bentley, four hundred, I pay the bond
You ain't scarin' no one with no gun in this bitch
Everybody go dumb in this bitch
Niggas hoes and they mama a bitch
In the hood like Obama and shit
Presidential tint, no tellin' who in it
Ask around, I bet they tell you we winnin'
Different foreign cars, ain't none of 'em rented
Hundred million cash, I'm comin' to get it
Out in Cali', but my mind in the trenches
I advise the boy to play his position
Run it up and show love to my city
Never leave 'em, I'm bringin' 'em with me
Keep a glizzy, it's goin' in with me, I can't let 'em get me
No time for bullshit, I'm sorry, I'm busy
I'ma go hard 'til I'm forty or fifty
Niggas be talkin', but they never do shit
So if it ain't money, I don't even listen

(Damn, Mikey)

I heard he been dissin' on the squad, we left his man sleep
Duckin’ silver bracelets, be precautious when the feds sweep
I want that brand new Bentley with the red seats
My pops was there for me, so I'll be damned, I be a deadbeat, uh
When you said you loved me, girl, you scared me
I'm fakin’ smiles, I'm hurt inside, can't let my fans see
They hear me talkin', but I don't think they understand me
Chеcks and deposits, young nigga swimmin' in them bands deep

Head on a swivеl, opposition like a block away
Teeth grittin' off them X pills, so high that I couldn't concentrate
I’m TimTim Gang, don’t add a K, 'cause I don’t think that's smart to say
Rock out with that TEC, might make a nigga do the Harlem Shake
Make sure that grass low, keep your pole and always watch for snakes
Be careful who you trust, 'cause they'll cross you like Tim Hardaway
Impatient in the slums, I couldn’t afford to let my mama wait
Long-distance relationship with God, so it get hard to pray
You can't really plan what's meant to be, I think they call it fate
Like girl, I love you, but it's only so much I can tolerate
Like girl, I love you, but it's only so much that my heart can take
Like let's give it a rest, girl, I just wanna give my heart a break

"78 ContributorsBloody Canvas Lyrics
Head's burnin', wasn't told
To leave, the world is burning down
Never had no help from anyone (I'm Harry, Harry Potter)

Uh, let me tell you 'bout a young nigga, he was only fourteen
Don't fuck with niggas, he stay social distanced like he quarantined
Went from NBA to torn dreams
And a street legend in between
That's when prayers made him hit his knees
See, he was born Cabrini-era back in '99
On Chicago North Side, where the news reportin' live
He can't help but rep his hood, damn near born on his block
And his parents had him young, they ain't really have a lot
Seen his daddy gang bangin', one day, he might take his spot
Five years old and he taught him how to aim a Glock, uh
""Use that bitch to protect your family,"" that's what he told him
A empty clip, he grabbed the gun and practiced what he showed him
And his family hood famous, pop out, everybody know him
And his people stuck for him so he won't let nobody ho him
Uncle's tellin' street stories, shit intriguin' like a poem
Sayin' shit like he'd put it to they neck if anybody owe him
All through his childhood, he was bad, but innocent
Playin' basketball with his homies, runnin' scrimmages
This who he cracked jokes, made a bond, and got suspended with
And when they saw the opps, they fist-fought to settle differences
'Til one day, the opps, they got tired of gettin' beat up
They big homies gave 'em guns like, ""Man, go and light they street up""
They puttin' hoodies on, all black, loadin' heat up
Adrenaline pumpin', now, they can't wait until they see us
Normal day on the block, it was fun and all smiles
But his best friend Jacob wandered off from the crowd
Took a walk to the store, headphones bangin' loud
Then his opps bent the corner, he ain't see 'em come around
When he looked up at the car, that's when them shots went, ""Baow""
Blood oozin' with his back on the ground
Vision blurry, heartbeat slowin' down
Blood comin' out his mouth, feel like he startin' to drown
Tires screechin', last thing he heard was that sound
""Jacob just got shot,"" that's what a lady screamed
Now everybody out of breath, runnin' to the scene
Seein' Jacob on the floor, that was some shit they couldn't believe
His eyes rolling back, his auntie trying to tell him, ""Breathe""
Died 'fore the paramedics came, she cryin', ""Baby, please""
Ain't even get to graduate 'cause he was only seventeen
Shorty cried all night, wishin' that shit was just a dream
'Til that pain turned into anger, time to make a nigga bleed
You might also like
Fuck, man
This nigga just took my best friend
And I, I can't go for that shit
It got me fucked up

And by the way, his name was Terrence, but they called him Sed
Dark skin, he wore a mean mug with some long dreads
Six-two, he good at hawkin' niggas down, he got long legs
Now he'll go and kill anybody that he want dead
They heard he caught his first body and that word spread
And he know how quick karma come around, but he wasn't scared
Sacrificed his soul in them streets like Illuminati
Now sellin' drugs and shootin' niggas, them his only hobbies
Big driller now, he the one to call and go and catch a homi'
Got the lo' on the nigga who killed his dawg, he want his second body
A lightskinned heavy-set nigga named Rodney
Say, ""He be out the west, off the Xans, movin' real sloppy""

Yo, what's the word?
Man, you won't believe who I found out the nigga who killed Jacob
It was the lil' nigga, Rodney
He be hangin' out up at the gas station on Pulaski, trying to make some money, nigga always out his mind
Oh, yeah?
Bet, say no more
Sed pulled up to the lo', lights off, it's like one o'clock
Grippin' on the silver Smith & Wesson with like thirty shots
He ain't gotta put one in the head, it's already cocked
Rodney got his back turned, he trying to sell his last rock
Sed hopped out the car, he ready to erase him
Rodney heard him comin', he gon' run before he let him fade him
It's like a demon in him 'cause his eyes red while he chase him
Rodney havin' some with regrets, now he just hopin' God save him
Shots to the leg, hollow tips ate him
Fell to the ground like his shoes, he ain't lace 'em
Sed walked up, stood over him like, ""Pussy, this for Jacob""
Gave him four shots to the stomach, then he faced him
Sed runnin' to his car, Rodney bleedin' on the pavement
He had untied his hoodie and they seen that on surveillance
Tryna match him to the footage, the police investigatin'
Plus they had his picture on the wall at the station
A week later, they had came and grabbed him from his mama house
Couldn't afford a lawyer in the county, fighting drama now
Said, ""Fuck it, takin' it to trial"", he ain't coppin' out
Judge gave him forty-nine years, now that's a lot to count

Now, prosecutors were asking for the judge to lock him up for up to twenty-five years
The judge gave him twenty-eight
Smith had the last word
Again, he was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison
He has thirty days, Kelly, to appeal that sentence, back to you28Embed",rap

I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today's a painful re-
Minder of why
It can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the
Inside lookin' out, ‘cause—

I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake
To start the mourning process and rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya, you weathered it and poked its
Eye out with the thornbush that ya used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner faster, more assertive, never looking back
May hit the curb, but every day's a new learning curve as ya
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
To avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad it's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chantin'
You might also like
I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died, 'cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep ‘cause you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in, that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the motherfreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you've been put through, this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burnin' quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin', you look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
Perspire from the heat, exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief, it's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still, a little piece of you dies as you scream—

I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I feel the burn
Watch the smoke as I turn, rising
A phoenix from the flames
I have learned
From fighting fights that weren't mine
It's not with fists
But with wings that I will fly
And I'm standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
To find the light, find the light, find the light
Standin' in the flames
And it’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light238Embed",rap

I swear I pop so many pills, shit got me losin’ weight
One minute, life was so hard, shit had me losin' faith
I know my haters checkin' on me, I been doin' great
I couldn’t get wrapped up in that drama, had to move away
Everything could change, depend on what you do today
You gotta live with each decision that you choose to make
I used to hustle to survive, I found a newer way
Remember high speeds in the hot car, tryna lose the jakes
You got your life in your hands until you lose a case

I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me

My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel (Angel), angel
Without the halo, wingless angel

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head (Skrrt, skrrt)

Yeah, look at you (You), boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart (For the heart)
I figured we could work it out, hmm

When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me

I know you're able, willin’ and able

Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue (Damn, damn)
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah

Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lookin' out tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown
Far out on that water, Father, don't let me drown
I can hear my grandma sayin', ""Don't let me down""
People wanna kill me, always keep my gun 'round
Pray I squeeze first, I can't lose the millies I found

Bussin' off the stoinky wishin' I was off a bean, no stalk
I was hungry for that money like a fiend
Too deep in that water, my life ain't have no order
Melodic blue stories, I'm feelin' like Baby Keem
I do my own thing, fuck it, I took seven shots, no shame
Back to wall, I'm still gon' blow you down, I ain't no stain
Flow on Wayne, I don't give a fuck about no ceiling
'Cause we catch a opp and send him to the sky (Doot)
They be like, ""Tjay, why do you move around with all them fuckin' guns?""
I just tell 'em that's 'cause I don't wanna die
And trust me, I don't lie, can't fuck up, I'm a star right now
If I wasn't quick to blow, I would be in the stars right now

Grateful for the shit I got 'cause I come from a hard life
Demons on my mental, saw some shit I wanna archive
Feds lookin' out tryna bring a nigga down
Just thinkin' 'bout the possibility, I frown

One day they'll stop overlookin' my gift, that's wallahi

These niggas back and forth tryna pop up like a ollie
You heard they killed who? Drugs talkin', sound like molly
Can someone tell the vlogs, ""Get off of my D""?
Never had no doubt if I'm gon' make it or no probably

Woah, yeah
Lil Tjay
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin' (Ooh)
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong (Oh)
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
(Dystinkt Beats)

Everything is going Gucci, see me Lou V
I can't let a nigga shoot me, I'm in a two seat
And before I speak about it, rather grab a loose leaf
Thirty clip of the dip, and I'm in a hoopty
And we spin the opp block with a mini Uzi
Had to send a couple shots, I been acting bougie
All the sudden all these thots let me in they coochie
They gon' make they pussy pop tryna get my blue cheese
Low-key I be in the streets tryna OD
Low-key 'cause the industry, I'm not the old me
Low-key started peeping niggas not my homies
Phony nigga ate that shit like macaroni
And I remember last year niggas went to Coney
Never thought that this year I'd have a deal with Sony
Lil TJay SB, I'm the one and only
And I just came home and everybody know me
If you want another G.O.A.T., guess you gotta clone me
Quit talkin' 'bout some loyalty you never showed me
Nigga, I don't owe you like you never owed me
Once I got a little clout, everybody know me
And we never had to prove this, we really do this
You was never in the field, you was on your school shit
Now my energy is boosted, my mind exuded
They gon' make a nigga lose it, they acting stupid
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots in my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean (Nah-nah)
I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that (I'm like)
You had your chance, but you blew that (Lil Tjay)
Everybody asking who that? (Oh, no, no, no, no)
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong

How you screamin', ""Day one,"" doin' fake shit?

Pull up on the S, show love, that be gang shit

Countin' blue strips, broke niggas gon' hate this
Mama so proud, I'ma take her on vacation
I be goin' hard, remember used to starve
Remember selling nicks right on the boulevard
Going downtown, tryna steal a nigga car
And if I call Tut he'll pull a nigga card
I don't play the field no more without a hammer
Brodie on the news, whole face on the camera
Free all my day one niggas out the slammer
Opp nigga told, black and white, he a panda
Got me finna run up in his crib like I'm Santa
All of this designer got me broads in Atlanta
Honestly, I ain't playin' games no more
And they been on my dick 'til my thing feel sore
Bitch said I'm trash, shorty, change your drawers

They say love don't cost a thing, that's lies
It costs time that you can't get back, high price
Give it your all, now you got nothin' left, nice try
Everything happens for a reason, that's life

I can't be how you need me, baby, time come with a fee
Heart colder than a glacier that you can't warm with a fleece
I been focused on a mil', dream chasin' like I'm Meek
I done stood ten toes down, still I had to face defeat
I been lookin' for an empty soul that I can fill with love
Know I'm 'posed to be a gangsta, lately, I just need a hug
I'm surrounded by some gangsters so I gotta remain tough
Niggas see you out there soft and they gon' think your ass a bluff
Pеople sayin' that I'm needy, even call mе greedy
Tryna play the victim, be the bad guy if need be
If loving me is hard, then walk away and make it easy
Not locking no one down, fuck a cuff, fuck a ""Free me""
Get away ASAP, finding me a Riri
Help me build a brand and put the money in a CD
Life a movie, TV, get to feeling 3D
Been cut so low now my wound is three feet deep

Dear Mark, you're the one with the words
But my side should be heard

All of your songs, hear about all of my wrongs

Like you never went out and did nothin' wrong
It's crazy forever turned into so long
And now that you're gone, I had to move on
And I'm happy with him
But I still can't pretend that I didn't go fuck with your friend
Every now and again
I be thinkin' of then
I be thinkin' that that was something I would never intend
And especially, when it was me who you trusted
To take on your feelings and try to remend, it's so hard pretend
I would lie in your bed, givin' you head
Listen to all of the things that you said
Listen to all of the lyrics you read
You were chasing a dream, I would party instead
Young and in love, young and we're dumb
I can taste all of the pain in your tongue
I can taste all of my pain in the rum
Knew it was over before it begun
Lookin' for fun, burning my lungs
Learnin' my favorite feeling was numb
Bought every dinner, you barely bought one
Maybe I cheat, and then we could be done
That would be done, we were so broke
You were the one that turned into a joke
I kept us afloat
You were the one that kept us on the rope, damn
Now you are the man, huh?
I see you turned into somebody I can't stand, huh?
Knowin' you, man, it is all part of your plan, huh?
You crazy fuck, I had the chance, I should've ran—uh!
Never would tell me you cared, never were there
Remember that night that we went to the fair?
Every fine girl that walked by, you would stare
See, even when there, Mark, you never were there
If all I care 'bout is my makeup and hair
All you care 'bout is the ego you wear
You tear me apart, continue to tear
Now I'm with someone who actually cares
Fuck you! But I can't keep you off my mind
I'm seein' everything you drop
Sometimes I wish that I was blind
You make me relive my mistake
A million trillion fucking times
See, you're a coward
And a stupid rap persona is what you hide behind
And my whole family still adores you
I tried a million times, I would have only did that for you
I can't act like I don't know you
Every night I would explode
You made me feel I was below you
Mark, I wish I could ignore you, but I can't, damn
You might also like
Near to you, I am healin'
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone and you are wonderful
It's hard to move on

What do...
How then, could you tell me you love me again and again
You were only a friend, it was hard to pretend
I wrote so many letters, but never hit send
I was never content, I was set on me being a rapper
I thought about music and thought of you after
It's funny how tears turn to laughter
And tears on the page, they can turn into a masterpiece
That's how you told me to leave
I remember that night, it's as clear as can be
You found a new man, and he loves that you drink
And he loves gettin' head, but don't care what you think
You look pretty in pink, you look naughty in red
We know these are the words that would never be said
And we're chasing a topic that's over your head
'Cause you think about me every night as you lie in your bed
That's… real

Near to you, I am healin'
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone and you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Near to you, I am healin'
But it's taking so long
'Cause though he's gone and you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Well, I guess we all change
Mark, I guess we all change
I hope that you get everything that you want
As you yell and you stand on the stage
You took all your pain and turned it to fame
They're screaming your name and going insane
I kept all our pics, but threw out the frame
Before I knew Witt, I knew Mark, now they're one and the same
But what about me, motherfucker?
Forgot about me, motherfucker?
Except when you talk about me, motherfucker
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout me, motherfucker
Your mouth was a blessin' and now it's a weapon
Remember the time and the love we invested
I'm postin' a pic and I'm getting attention
My tits and my ass get a favorite a second
See, you were with me but were thinking of her
Now I'm with him and I'm thinking of you
Together to never, whatever we were
We're stuck in a cycle, the cycle is cruel
A couple of fools, stuck in a pool
Of people that want to be cool
See, we're never happy, we're happy
So we keep on searching for love as if love was a jewel
Remember that night that you came to my school?
Stayed up all night and we talked about life
My parents and I, we would constantly fight
You said when you make it, I might be a stay-at-home wife
Apparently that wasn't right
Relivin' a moment that lasted a night
And, honestly, Mark, gotta start to move on with your life
Sincerely, a letter we never would... write
Like, what are we doin'? Like, what am I doin'?
Writing these letters, but what am I provin'?
I'm stuck in my room and I'm spilling it all
Making up what you would say if you call
I might be the biggest mistake of 'em all
My biggest mistake was to think that I never could fall
Like falling for you, fallin' in love
Follow my dream and that's all of my love
I just want to feel, I've been feelin' so numb
To think that I know how you're feelin' is dumb
We're done, right from the start
I write from the heart, a light in the dark
They see that you're open and tear you apart
Now this is our letter, we sign it sincerely, Mark
Now this is our letter, we sign it sincerely, Mark36Embed",rap

My youngins, they be on that gang shit

When it come to that iron, we slang shit
I'ma stay on this road 'til my lane switch
On  the road getting chicken, but we call it flicken, these niggas ain't speaking my language
Pussy boy, I don't fuck with that lame shit
It be hard to stay low 'cause this fame shit
Had his thot give me mop in the back of my Bimmer
It's crazy, you call her your main bitch
Every link-up, it's always the same shit
Now you ducking, I know that the pain hit

Said you wouldn't be an opp
Had your bitch give me top
Told the guys, I'm like, ""Bro, this is gang shit""
White gold, I ain't rocking no stainless
Fill your head with three hollows, you brainless
Put them goons on your ass, they looking for cash
You fuck around, boy, and be chainless
My city, I'm tryna rename this
Run up on me, head tap, now you famous
And I heard niggas looking for me
And I heard niggas looking for bro
Pop out, I be icy and clean
New drip from my head to my toe
Catch an opp back to back in a row
Bullets burning, we get him, skip states and get low
Ordered my food then I took it to go
I was 13 tryna flip me an O
When I ain't know nothing, I knew I would blow
I knew that one day I'd sell out a show
I know these fuck niggas want me to lose
Thanks for the haters for helping me grow
I got some feelings I never let show
Do it for Smelly, forever my bro
Ride through my city, I'm droppin' the fours

""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed",rap

Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it
This chick got a lil' Porsche body, I might let the bro test drive it
It's hard for me to get excited, I love music, and stress 'bout it
My city haulin' and I'm cosigning this wave, comin' up next out it
Ridin' 'round and this shotgun in her Tesla
Hangin' both of my legs out of it, like ""What's up?"" (What's up?)

Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them 12 foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me

Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished

So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe

I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD

I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct (And my instinct)
Shootin' at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thing, tryna repeat (Repeat)
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it, out the sun roof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast from police
Shots fired back, but his ass in the street
When I bought a forty, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call, it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lot of warfare, 17, had a 50 piece
Flexed on niggas so you know they wanna kill a G

(Loyalty) Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean
I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head

We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl (Yeah)
Conceal and revealing to people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil, in case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets (Tsk)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I forget about you long enough

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell

When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez

Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found

Almost Heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads

Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong

Take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road, I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

Could have turned Dalai with the llama, but I squashed my

To be looking decent recently, but don't jinx it
It's like Clint Eastwood looking for peace though
Maybe not finna enter the priesthood
But at least should make an attempt to
Show some remorse and to be some sort of repenter
For the people, I've been a menace to
Not a preacher but a shit starter and finisher
Enter the mind of a thick skin, but a short temper
This patience of mine is thinner

Get attacked, so I might say something back

So if you don't like when I rap or what I have to
Say on the mic, then ya might wanna act just
Like quarterbacks and take a fuckin' hike when I snap 'cause

They tend to flock like shepherds, the black sheep

Showed you all of my hiding spots

And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention

But there was happiness because of you

There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

But there was happiness because of you too

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

When you said you needed space (What?)

I had a dream about a burning house
You were stuck inside, I couldn't get you out
I laid beside you and pulled you close
And the two of us went up in smoke
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong
I'll stay here with you until this dream is gone

I've been sleepwalking
Been wandering all night
Trying to take what’s lost and broke
And make it right
I've been sleepwalking
Too close to the fire
But it's the only place that I can hold you tight
In this burning house

See you at a party and you look the same
I could take you back but people don't ever change
Wish that we could go back in time
I'd be the one you thought you'd find
Love isn't all that it seems I did you wrong

Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?

The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same

It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now

You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

Screaming, ""This is absurd""

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""

Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter, Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes, without topses
Sandals were for Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Drove she ducklings to the water
Ev'ry morning just at nine
Hit her foot against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Blowing bubbles, soft and fine
But, alas, I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine
Oh my darling, oh my darling
Oh my darling, Clementine
You are lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
How I missed her! How I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
But I kissed her little sister
I forgot my Clementine

Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmmm...

They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

And brought me back from bein' too far gone

You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time

I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it

Oh, my daddy said shoot

With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible

When trouble comes in town and men like me come around""

Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

And then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak?
Nah, I'll tell you what a woman loves most
It's a man who can slap but can also stroke

Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked

And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care

My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said

Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

When he came across this young man sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""
""I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too
And if you'd care to take a dare I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul 'cause I think I'm better than you.""

The boy said, ""My name's Johnny, and it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

The Devil opened up his case and he said, ""I'll start this show.""
And fire flew from his fingertips as he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this:

She could go home, but she's not going to

So she picks a direction, it's ninety to Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants or what she's gonna do

I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it’s always on your terms
I’m hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I’d run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man

Oh, the year was 1778
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
A letter of marque came from the king
To the scummiest vessel I've ever seen
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Oh, Elcid Barrett cried the town
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
For twenty brave men all fishermen who
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She'd a list to the port and her sails in rags
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Pumping like madmen all the way
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

On the 96th day we sailed again
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four pounders we made to fight
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

Now the Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers
Then at length we stood two cables away
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Our cracked four pounders made an awful din
But with one fat ball, the Yank stove us in
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
And the Main truck carried off both me legs
God damn them all! I was told
We'd cruise the seas for American gold
We'd fire no guns, shed no tears
But I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
The last of Barrett's Privateers

So here I lay in my 23rd year
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
It's been 6 years since we sailed away
And I just made Halifax yesterday

Boy gets a guitar and starts writin' songs
'Bout whiskey and women and gettin' too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, ""I don't think Jesus done it that way""

Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasin' the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignorin' the voices in his head that say
""I don't think Jesus done it this way""

If I was Him I'd say, ""To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you""
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray, 'cause what else could he do?
He said, ""I wish You would've woke me up an easier way""
But I don't think Jesus does it that way

With a bleached-blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

Slashed a hole in all four tires

Yeah! Ooh, some people extending my name, ""Boo"", that's also approval! I- I think- I think country music Get's a bad- Get's a bad rep, you know? Why is it, when Bruce Springsteen sings about a- when Bruce Springsteen sings about a fuckin' turnpike, it is art, and then when someone sings about a horse, it's dumb, inherently? I don't know, I think some of the greatest song writers of all time are country artists: Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, you know? And if you're writing honestly, that is art! And I would never bash that! Um, the problem is, with a lot of modern country music, wha- what is called ""Stadium Country Music""
Sort of Keith Urban Brand of Country music is that it is not honest, it is the exact opposite of honest
*Country music starts playing and Bo speaks in a faux-country accent*
Where instead of people actually telling their stories, you got a bunch of millionaire metrosexuals who've never done a hard days work in their life, but they figured out the words and the phrases they can use to pander to their audience, and they list the same words and phrases off sort of mad libs style in every song, raking in millions of dollars from actual working class people! You know the words, you know the phrases, phrases like--

A dirt road, a cold beer
A blue jeans, a red pickup
A rural noun, simple adjective
No shoes, no shirt
No Jews, you didn't hear that
Sort of a mental typo

I walk and talk like a field hand
But the boots I'm wearing cost three grand
I write songs about riding tractors
From the comfort of a private jet

I could sing in Mandarin
You'd still know I'm pandering

Hear that subtle mandolin
That's textbook panderin'

¡Bella! Ella sabe que está buena
Que todos andan mirándola cómo baila
Me acerco y le tiro todo un verbo
Tomamos tragos sin peros, solo tentación
Le dije: ""Voy a conquistar tu familia, que en unos días vas a ser mía""
Me dijo que estoy muy loco, pero le gusta
Que ningún vato como yo actúa

Y ahí te va, mija
Y pura Doble P, viejo
Así nomás, compa Pedro
Puro Eslabon Armado
Pa' las plebitas
¡Cha-chau!

No soy un vato que tiene varo
Pero hablando del corazón te cumplo todo
Me agarró pegadito dе su mano
Mi compa ni se la creyó, que al pasar fui yo
Su cuеrpo, juro por Dios, que era tan perfecta
Su cinturita como modelo
Sus ojos desde el principio me enamoraron
A ella le gusto y a mí me gusta

(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers
On a highway to heaven, headed south of her smile, mmm

To the town of Agua Fria
Rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him
Didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them
Had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning
When he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side
Slowly looking all around
""He's an outlaw loose and running""
Came the whisper from each lip
""And he's here to do some business
With the big iron on his hip""
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw
By the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him
And that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer
Though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol
Numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking
Made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona Ranger
Wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw
Back alive, or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter
He was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story
Was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry
Men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him
Twenty men had made a slip
Twenty-one would be the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly
It was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven
When they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from the windows
Everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome Ranger
Was about to meet his death
'Bout to meet his death
There was forty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger
Is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather
'Fore a bullet fairly ripped
And the Ranger's aim was deadly
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment
And the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body
Of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin'
But he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron
When he tried to match the Ranger
With the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip27Embed",country

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony

I was a highwayman
Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of '25
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across a river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder, on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around
And around, and around, and around
And around, and around, and around...

Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again
And again, and again, and again
And again, and again...20Embed",country

Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny-boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner, aaah

Now, the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

And now, Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible (Oh, dou-dou-dou)
Gideon checked out, and he left it, no doubt (Oooh Rocky, oooh)
To help with good Rocky's revival, aah

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does

Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

"55 ContributorsWild Horses Lyrics
Childhood living is easy to do
The things you wanted, I bought them for you
Graceless lady, you know who I am
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain
Now you decided to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried

Mate, what do you think of that girl?
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself
Beautiful, she knows she's hot
Everyone's watching her dance
I approach her and lay on the charm
We drink without reservations, just temptation
I told her, ""I'm going to win over your family, and in a few days you'll be mine""

She told him, ""You'll forget in time""
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
But he still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again

He kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single 'I love you'
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years

"41 ContributorsEl Paso Lyrics
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment, I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul, evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance, and that was to run
You might also like
Out through the back door of Rosa's, I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back, and away I did ride

Just as fast as I could
From the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

I saddled up, and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Feleena is strong, and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye13Embed",country

If the right one don't getcha then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?

Saint Peter don't you call me, 'cause I can't go

"7 ContributorsSan Antonio Rose Lyrics
Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
Well, it was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
For that moonlit pass that only he would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor known only to my heart
Call back my rose rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antone

Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And rose my rose of San Antone

"11 ContributorsWorkin’ Man Blues Lyrics
It's a big job just getting by with nine kids and a wife
But I've been a working man dang near all my life
And I'll keep on working
As long as my two hands are fit to use

I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

I'll keep my nose on the grindstone, work hard every day
I might get a little tired on the weekend, after I draw my pay
But I'll go back to working
Come Monday morning I'm right back with the crew

I'll drink a little beer that evening
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

Sometimes I think about leaving, do a little bummin' around
I want to throw my bills out the window, catch a train to another town
But I'll go back working
I gotta buy my kids a brand new pair of shoes

Well, hey-hey, the working man, the working man, like me
I ain't never been on welfare and that's one place I won't be
'Cause I'll be working
As long as my two hands are fit to use

I'll drink my beer in a tavern
Sing a little bit of these working man blues

"55 ContributorsI Walk The Line Lyrics
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide

"20 ContributorsMama Tried Lyrics
The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young'un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
And no one could change my mind but mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family meek and mild
My mama seemed to know what lay in store
Despite all my Sunday learning
Towards the bad I kept on turning
'Til mama couldn't hold me anymore

And I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole
No one could steer me right but mama tried, mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause mama tried

Dear old daddy, rest his soul
Left my mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

"17 ContributorsCoal Miner’s Daughter LyricsWell, I was born the coal miner's daughter
In a cabin on a hill in Butcher Holler
We were poor, but we had love
That's the one thing that Daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar
My Daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines
All day long in the field hoeing corn
Mommy rocked the babies at night
And read the Bible by the coal-oil light
And everything would start all over come break of morn
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard every day
Why, I've seen her fingers bleed
To complain, there was no need
She's smiled in Mommy's understanding way
In the summertime, we didn't have shoes to wear
But in the wintertime, we'd all get a brand new pair
From a mail-order catalog
Money made from selling a hog
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter
I remember well the well where I drew water
The work we done was hard
At night, we'd sleep 'cause we were tired
I never thought of ever leaving Butcher Holler

"5 ContributorsOld Dogs, Children And Watermelon Wine Lyrics
""How old do you think I am?"" he said
I said, Well, I didn't know
He said, ""I turned 65 about 11 months ago""
I was sittin' in Miami pourin' blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
There wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watchin' 'Ironsides' on TV
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
""Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?"" he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
""Ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
He said, ""Women think about theyselves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down""
He said, ""I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine""
Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
'Bout old dogs and children and watermelon wine
I had to catch a plane up to Atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him pickin' up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime
Of old dogs and children and watermelon wineYou might also like1Embed",country

Wo der Vetter Bob in 'nem Methlabor seine Päckchen kocht
Allein mit Tape Recorder dort in 'nem Kinderzimmer
Großgezogen auf Peter Tosh, Dylan und Lynyrd Skynyrd

Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on, and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Blowin' soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along; you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me

Hold your warm and tender body close to mine

"3 ContributorsRainy Day Woman Lyrics
紫の入江のように
都会は季節の帆をたたんでいる
あなたより先に目覚めて
寝顔を見つめて5分泣いたわ
グラスに半分のジン・ライム
口移しに注がれたひと夏の光と影
It's rainy rainy day 微笑みより涙を
It's rainy rainy day 選ぶ女がいてもいい
It's rainy rainy day 不思議だけど別れの日は
決ってこんな雨の朝
心など置き忘れても
淋しさ重ねた夜はレザリアム
こんな事ねえいつまでも
続けていたって仕方ないもの
誰かに聞かれたら
あんな女こちらから捨てたよと言えばいいわ
It's rainy rainy day 舞い戻ってくるさと
It's rainy rainy day 置き手紙破っても
It's rainy rainy day 髪を濡らす光る粒に
誓って真剣な気持ち
真珠のネックレスほどき
濡れた舗道に並べるわ
さよならのアルファベット

Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took me astray?
If you do then forgive me
And make the world go away

Make the world go away
And get it off my shoulders
Say the things you used to say
And make the world go away

I'm sorry if I hurt you
I'll make it up day by day
Just say you love me like you used to
And make the world go away

Make the world go away

"24 ContributorsCoat of Many Colors Lyrics
Back through the years I go wandering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mama put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
You might also like
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me
Made just for me3Embed",country

"12 ContributorsForever and Ever, Amen Lyrics
You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love that I feel for you, always will be
But you're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live, this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die, oh, baby

I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girl's brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you anyway
They say that time can play tricks on a memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you, oh, darling
You might also like
I'm gonna love you forever
Forever and ever, Amen
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Well, just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen

I'm gonna love you forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Forever and ever, Amen1Embed",country

"7 ContributorsSmoky Mountain Rain Lyrics
I thumbed my way
From LA back to Knoxville
I found out those bright lights
Ain't where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain
I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams
I'm coming home
But tears filled my eyes
When I found out she was gone

Smoky Mountain rain
Keeps on falling
I keep on calling her name
Smoky Mountain rain
I'll keep on searching
I can't go on hurting this way
She's somewhere in the Smoky Mountain rain

I waved a diesel down outside a cafe
He said that he was going
As far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab
All wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes
And told him about her
I've got to find her

From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains other the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball


Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

Which was fit between the Yankees of course and them there English people
In which the British came off rather ignominiously

Well in 1814, we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Packenham down the mighty Mississipp'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we fought the bloomin British in the town of New Orleans
Well, we fired our guns and the British kept a comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began a running
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexicoooo, yeh
Weeell, we looked down the river till we see the British come
There must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring
Well, we stood beside our cotton bales and never sayed a thing
Well, we fired our guns and the British kept a comin'

I ran off to the bar
Another piece of heaven gone to hell
The words we spoke in anger
Just tore my world apart
And I sat there feeling sorry for myself

And looked me in the eye
And said ""Son, I know what you're going through
You ought to get down on your knees

And you don't know about sadness
'til you faced life alone
You don't know about lonely

So I brought these pretty flowers
Hoping you would understand
Sometimes a man is such a fool
Those golden words of wisdom
From the heart of that old man
Showed me I ain't nothing without you

"8 ContributorsTight Fittin’ Jeans Lyrics
She tried to hide it by the faded denim clothes she wore
But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fitting jeans

I asked her what's a woman like you doing here
I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer
She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fitting jeans

She said I married money, I'm used to wearing pearls
But I've always dreamed of being just a good ol' boys' girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner, there's a tiger in these tight fitting jeans

We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans

In my mind she's still a lady, that's all I'm gonna say
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans

Well now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine
But I know she’ll always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
And Lord I love that lady wearing tight fitting jeansEmbed",country

Ever heard a breakin' heart when a love dies?
Feel it comin', swear there'll never be another
But now I'm standin' right in front of
The monster I locked in my closet oh so long ago
Maybe I'm bein' too cautious
But I remember when I lost it
And I just pray this doesn't cost us our soul (Soul)
And if I'm still here when you wake up from your sleep

Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
And did I hear you say he was a-meetin' you here today
To take you to his mansion in the sky?

She's forty-one, and her daddy still calls her baby
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy
'Cause she walks downtown with her suitcase in her hand
Looking for a mysterious dark haired man
In her younger days, they called her Delta Dawn
Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side
Promised her he'd take her for his bride

Hum a lonely song
Nights underneath the stars and moon

Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

No where to go, but I'll find
Just where the trail will wind

Is anybody listening?
It's like I'm yelling, but I'm whispering
It's like it doesn't even matter
(I'm talking fast), but it's idle chatter
If you can feel me, hear me out
I got something to talk about
I promise I won't waste your time
Nevermind, I'm lying

Hello walls, hello ceiling
No one's home, and I'm feeling
All alone
Hello bed, hello pillow
When I'm high, I still feel low
No one knows me like my things
But no one answers when I scream:
""Hello walls!""
(And I keep feeling invisible)

Laying in this bed I fear
Me filling my brain with some leads right near
I think if I do this my head I clear
Or maybe I should overdose on these meds right here
Everytime I get ahead a wall hits me, fall quick
Do y'all history, when it came to my artistry it was all iffy
The laws just be raw, this we call shifty
Tall chips to fix me, ball, stalled, it be all thrifty
I don't let nobody see my pain behind these walls
Bet this blade will help me see my veins
Cause these walls are caving in and the ceiling's getting closer to me
Everybody is unhappy with me and taking away all dough's a doozy
I feel so, helpless and nervous that I will go ill
So freaking real though and spill slow
Caribou Coffee tryna stop my 'Bou Lou mill
So my grill show daily, but nightly tears upon my pillow
Right now I'm real low
So..

Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On this damned old L.A. street""
Then he drew a dying breath
And laid his head against my chest
Please, Lord, take his soul back home to Dixie

Run back home to that Southern land

And fell limp, against my side

We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take no trips on LSD;
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street

We don't make a party out of loving
But we like holding hands and pitching woo;
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee

We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen;
A football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids here still respect the college dean

"51 ContributorsYou Are My Sunshine Lyrics
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away


I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

"6 ContributorsSilver Wings LyricsFrom tender years you took me for granted
But still I deigned to wander through your lungs
While you were sleeping soundly in your bed
Your drapes were silver wings; your shutters flung
I drew the poison from the summer's sting
And eased the fire out of your fevered skin
I moved in you and stirred your soul to sing
And if you'd let me, I would move again
I've danced 'tween sunlit strands of lover's hair
Helped form the final words before your death
I've pitied you and plied your sails with air
Gave blessing when you rose upon my breath
And after all of this, I am amazed
That I am cursed far more than I am praisedSee Thrice LiveGet tickets as low as $45You might also likeEmbed",country

Blame it all on my roots, I showed up in boots
And ruined your black-tie affair
The last one to know, the last one to show

And I saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
And I toasted you, said, ""Honey, we may be through
But you'll never hear me complain""

Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases

Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So, I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart?

If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her?
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one?
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face the world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes?

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelin's for them never were revealed
So, I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel

They'd dance all night till the break of day
When the caller hollered ""do-se-do""
You knew Uncle Pen was ready to go
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
He played an old piece he called ""Soldier's Joy""
And the one called ""The Boston Boy""
The greatest of all was ""Jenny Lynn""
To me that's where the fiddle begins
Late in the evening about sundown
High on the hill and above the town
Uncle Pen played the fiddle lord how it would ring
You could hear it talk, you could hear it sing
I'll never forget that mournful day
When Uncle Pen was called away
They hung up his fiddle, they hung up his bow
They knew it was time for him to go

"6 ContributorsThe Year That Clayton Delaney Died Lyrics
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me, although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did

Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton, who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee

Well, daddy said he drank a lot, but I could never understand
I knew he used to pick up in Ohio with a five-piece band
Clayton used to tell me, ""Son, you better put that ol' guitar away
There ain't no money in it, it'll lead you to an early grave""

I guess if I'd admit it, Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half-stoned, picking out the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died, I made him a promise, I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now

I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
While I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking, too

He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store

The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk

And things didn't work out, I was down on my luck
Got tired a-roamin' and bummin' around
So I started thumbin' back East, toward my home town
Made a lot of miles, the first two days
And I figured I'd be home in week, if my luck held out this way
But, the third night I got stranded, way out of town
At a cold, lonely crossroads, rain was pourin' down
I was hungry and freezin', done caught a chill
When the lights of a big semi topped the hill
Lord, I sure was glad to hear them air brakes come on
And I climbed in that cab, where I knew it'd be warm
At the wheel sit a big man, he weighed about two-ten
He stuck out his hand and said with a grin
""Big Joe's the name"", I told him mine
And he said: ""The name of my rig is Phantom 309.""
I asked him why he called his rig such a name
He said: ""Son, this old Mack can put 'em all to shame
There ain't a driver, or a rig, a-runnin' any line
Ain't seen nothin' but taillights from Phantom 309.""
Well, we rode and talked the better part of the night
When the lights of a truck stop came in sight
He said: ""I'm sorry son, this is as far as you go
'Cause, I gotta make a turn, just on up the road.""

Told the waiter Big Joe was settin' me up

And the waiter's face turned kinda white
Well, did I say something wrong? I said with a halfway grin
He said: ""Naw, this happens every now and then
Ever' driver in here knows Big Joe
But son, let me tell you what happened about ten years ago
At the crossroads tonight, where you flagged him down
There was a bus load of kids, comin' from town
And they were right in the middle, when Big Joe topped the hill
It could have been slaughter, but he turned his wheel
Well, Joe lost control, went into a skid
And gave his life to save that bunch-a kids
And there at that crossroads, was the end of the line
For Big Joe and phantom 309

But it just wasn't in my plans
The way that Linda squeezed my hand
The first time that I held her close
As she danced with me

She said, ""I've loved you for a long time

And I've tried hard to never let it show

Ten years ago, on a cool dark night
There was someone killed 'neath the town hall light
There were few at the scene, and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word, although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
Nobody knows, no, and nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones

All day I've faced a barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I with throats burned dry
And souls that cry for water
Cool, clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star's a pool of water
Cool water
And with the dawn I'll wake and yawn
And carry on to water
Cool, clear water

Keep a-movin, Dan, dontcha listen to him, Dan
He's a devil, not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan, can ya see that big, green tree?
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for you and me?

Oh, I'll twine with my mingles and waving black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald dew
The pale amanita and eyes look like blue

I will dance, I will sing, and my loft shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming my idol was clay
All portion of love had all flown away

Oh, he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell

Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That's blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour

And how his first word about that old truck was Giddyup Go
Well today I was barrelin' down old 66
When up beside me pulled down a brand new diesel rig
Both stacks of blowin' black coal
And as she pulled around and back in front of me
A big ole lump came in my throat
And my eyes watered like I had a bad old cough
A little sign on the back of the truck that read Giddyup Go
Well I pushed old Giddyup Go stayed right on him
Until the next truck stop where he'd pulled up
I waited till he went in and I offered to buy him a cup
Well we got to talkin' shop and I said
Now did you come by the name on your truck Giddyup Go
Well he said I got it from my pop
Dad used to drive a truck that's what mom talked about a lot
You see I lost mom when I was just past sixteen
And I lost all track of pop cause mom said he got the name from me
I shook his hand and told him that I had something I wanted him to see
I took him out to the old truck
And brushed off some of the dirt so the name would show
And his eyes got big and bright as he read Giddyup Go
Oh we had a lot of things to talk about and buddy I felt like a king
And now we've just pulled back on the old 66
And he's handled that big rig
Better than any gearjammer that I'd ever seen
Well sir now the lines on the highway have got much brighter glow
As we go roarin' down the road

There's a flag folded three-cornered

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice""

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right""

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep

Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep

Where, mister, when you're young
They bring you up to do
Like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school
When she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley
Down to where the fields were green

We'd go down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

Then I got Mary pregnant
And, man, that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday
I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse
And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we did ride

On a Greyhound bus
Lord, I'm traveling this morning
I'm going to Shreveport
And down to New Orleans
Been traveling these highways
Been doing things my way
It's been making me lonesome, ornery, and mean

Now her hair was jet black
And her name was Codeine
She thought she was the cream
Of the Basin Street Queens
She got tired of that smoky wine dream
Began to feel lonesome, ornery, and mean


We got together
And we cashed in our sweeps
Gave 'em to a beggar
Who was mumblin' through the streets
There's no escaping from his snowy white dreams
Born lookin' lonesome, ornery, and mean

Who would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke
Would get me riches like dealing coke?
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote
While they was firing, you could hear sirens
From people dialing 911 crying in the phone
I was in the zone, trying to make a living
Heading to work in the morning
Everyday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased
Elevated to levels I ain’t ever seen
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now
I’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s
Always shouting out my team ’cause I get all the praise
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days
See I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation
From the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations
As a youngin I was running wild
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud
Doing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah
Now when my mama was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills
I was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page
And paints a picture of another age
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark
‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down
‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down
We just trying to make a living off of what we’ve been given

Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts
Back as a youngin, spitting game, tryna get the nut in
Living life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing
My flow unkillable when I be murdering syllables
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb
I be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love
That’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor
Tryna get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed
That’s the type of shit I need

Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate
‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before
My life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips
Both my hands on her hips, ’til she put 'em on her tits
Freak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit
I’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wildin' out
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought
Then again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night

On the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear, young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid
Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So, their love could never be

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldn't die

He couldn't swim the raging river
'Cause the river was too wide
He couldn't reach Little White Dove

In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses 'cross the waves

Met a girl with a drink in her hand
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair

Then she came and sat down at my table
And as she placed her soft hands in mine
I found myself wanting to kiss her
For temptation was flowing like wine
And I was almost persuaded
To strip myself of my pride
Almost persuaded
To push my conscience aside
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you""
""Take me away from here and be my man""

And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh
And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

I like to imitate ol' Jerry Lee
An' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things I love to like about you
But they all come down to one reason I could never live without you

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love meEmbed",country
"7 ContributorsLove Can Build a Bridge Lyrics
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?
Yeah, yes I do
Oh

Love can build a bridge (Oh, love and only love)
Between your heart and mine (Between your heart and mine)
Love can build a bridge (Love and only love)
Don't you think it's time?
Oh, don't you think it's time?
Love and only love

"10 ContributorsLookin’ For Love Lyrics
Well I spent a lifetime looking for you
Single bars and good time lovers were never true
Playing a fool's game
Hoping to win
And telling those sweet lies and losing again

I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

And I was alone then
No love in sight
I did every thing I could to get me through the night
Don't know where it started
Or where it might end
I'd turn to a stranger just like a friend

'Cause I was lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Hoping to find a friend and a lover
I'll bless the day I discover
Another heart lookin' for love

And you came a knockin'
At my heart's door
You're everything I've been lookin' forrrrrrrr

There's no more lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You
Oh, you, lookin' for love

Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered
You
Oh, you, lookin' for love
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
Lookin' for love in too many faces
Searchin' their eyes
Lookin' for traces
Of what I'm dreamin' of
Now that I've found a friend and a lover
God bless the day I discovered

"5 ContributorsTake These Chains from My Heart LyricsTake these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care
For the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on

"3 ContributorsThe Closer You Get Lyrics
The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

Could I be dreaming
Is this really real
Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight

The closer you get, oh yeah, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, mmhmm, the further I fall

"63 ContributorsFolsom Prison Blues Lyrics
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby, my mama told me, ""Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns""
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry

I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well, I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin', and that's what tortures me

Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues awayYou might also like26Embed",country
